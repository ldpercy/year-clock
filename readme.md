Year Clock

A bit like a regular analog clock, but instead of 12 hours has 12 months.

For a 'minute hand' you could have the days of the month.

For a 'second hand' you could have the time of day.

I wonder if I could borrow some of the code from the first one ...



Calendar tie in
---------------

If you could sync it with a calendar/schedule of some sort you could highlight certain dates for reminders, add links etc.
