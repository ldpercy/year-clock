Year Clock
==========

A bit like a regular analog clock, but instead of the regular 12 hour divisions it has the 12 months of the year.

The 'hour hand' points to the time of year.


Existing
--------
It's already been done of course.
Over two thousand years ago, on the front face of the [Antikythera mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism).

Andy Brice and Ian Brice version
--------------------------------

I've started with code from [year-clock.net](http://year-clock.net) to use as a base.


Progress
--------

### Currently working on

* Customisable theming and styling of the clock face


### Potential features

* A 'minute hand' pointing to the time of month
* A 'second hand' pointing to the time of day
* Calendar integration
