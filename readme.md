Year Clock
==========

A bit like a regular analog clock, but instead of 12 hours has 12 months.

For a 'minute hand' you could have the days of the month.

For a 'second hand' you could have the time of day.

If you could sync it with a calendar/schedule of some sort you could highlight certain dates for reminders, add links etc.

It's already been done of course.
Over two thousand years ago, the front face of the [Antikythera mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism).

I wonder if I could borrow some of the code from the first one ...

Andy Brice version

I'm going to take [Andy Brice's version](year-clock.net) and start tinkering with it.
