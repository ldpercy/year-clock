Original dark theme
===================

There are some styles for a dark theme in the original CSS.
Want to move these to a theme folder and try them out.

Will use this to do some prelim work on theming.

It's working
------------

I've split the small dark theme style block into a separate theme, and now they can be switched with URL params.

This relies on the regular 'original' styles being present and just overriding the relevant rules.

Which leads to a few more thoughts about theming, which I've added to that task.
