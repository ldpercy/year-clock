Date-range formatting
=====================

Internally everything uses half-open intervals for date ranges, but for display purposes it might be a bit friendlier to show time periods as ending on their *last* day instead.

This would depend a bit on the case and target audience, so it's a stylistic choice.

Also, for [custom date highlighting](<custom date highlighting.md>) I might want to allow for the option of specifying closed date ranges.
