Lightning theme
===============

This is just a theme variant for a bit of fun.

Instead of using a hand to point to the current date, light up the current sectors for season, month, week and day - might look a little like lightning.

Might change this one to use quarters instead of seasons.

New requirements:
* Quarter array
* week array
* 'current' sector class additions
