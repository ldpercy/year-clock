Vintage clock
=============

```
2025-07-15		1.3.0	Done
2025-07-16		1.3.1	Small design tweaks
```

I've been messing about with different fonts and colours on the wall clock to try to get a more old-timey look.
Only so much I can do with styles, will begin a new theme.

This one could use some more fancy SVG features like gradients to try simulating things wood grain, embossing, aging etc.
Could finally add some different hand shapes as well.

I'll reuse the old sector-day theme that's been sitting neglected.

Wallpaper and body
------------------
Have these added using some basic gradients - looks okay in a cartoony sort of way.

Will start working on the actual clock face next.


Plain-svg & Hands
-----------------
Also have tweaked the old plain-svg theme for fun to produce a translucent glassy sort of effect that looks nice with darker backgrounds.
The stroke-width for the hand needs to be sorted out though.
I've used it to fatten the hand in some cases, but that messes up setting an actual outline, which I want in this case.
I want to create some new hands for the vintage clock so will try to sort them out together.


Day label bug
-------------

Working on the clock face now, it's a bit of a mishmash of ideas so far.

Trying to draw labels for the month-day sectors and something weird is turning up - I think there's a small bug in `getPeriodDayArray`.

It uses `dateRangeRadians` to generate sector angles, but that particular function assumes that the date range takes place within the context of years.
I did generalise it a while back though so that it should work across year boundaries (fingers crossed).

However for getPeriodDayArray the angular context isn't necessarily obvious.
Probably it's usually going to be that the date range represents one revolution, but that isn't a given.
You could be doing a dial/meter type readout where the full range is represented by a third of a circle.
Probably the angle calculations should actually be separated from the array creation as they're separate concerns.


Removing the current radians calc from getPeriodDayArray breaks lightning, debug and vintage.
In each case it's getSectorLabels that breaks because it relies on the stock yearDayArray created in createDisplayDate:

	result.yearDayArray = getPeriodDayArray(startOfYear(date), nextYear(date), date);

So what to do here?
Not every clock needs a yearDayArray, though nearly all do.
They should possibly be removed from createDisplayDate and only implemented when needed.
The season array should also be moved out. The month array is the only reasonably common one for now.
Also, not every clock breaks when I remove the sector angles, so I might need to do a quick audit of how each clock is actually doing it.

Even though it needs it, I don't won't to go too much into cleaning up the displayDate object right now.


Calc radians on array
---------------------

Need to abstract out the radians calc.
Need something that I can apply to an array with a [].map() or similar

Done.
The radians calcs have been pulled out of getPeriodDayArray and moved to the themes.
It's a little bit messier now in a way, but the concerns and implementations are more properly grouped.


Design
------

Have it sort of how I'd envisioned early on, but I don't think it looks that good right now.
Will need some more experimentation to find something cohesive.
Probably need a more solid idea of 'vintage' to get the look right, so I'm going to to start working off actual clockface example photos for this one.
I think I want something sort of first half 20th century, fairly traditional.
Also the wallpaper I've done, while I like it, it's a bit retro and might not be the best match for this; might need something a touch more subdued, a colour tweak or two might be enough.


### Multiple formatters

I'm toying with the design and wondering if both month numbers and names in different rings might look interesting.
That would require having multiple formatters for certain fields, and ways to specify which to use where - I think they're hardcoded currently so need a way to parameterise that.


getMonthLabels & getSectorLabels
--------------------------------

`getMonthLabels` is one of the older methods that's been on the list for chopping for a while.
It's still widely used though so will have to see if can easily be replaced by getSectorLabels.
The name of the latter is a bit unfortunate, but not sure what would be better yet.

I speculated above about different kinds of angular contexts for some things like days/months and I've been half thinking about doing a car-dashboard theme to explore exactly that - year/month/day using circle parts to look like speedos/ tachos fuel gauges etc.
Think I'll add it as a new task for fun.

I was thinking that maybe in a different full-range content 'sector' might make less sense, but actually while the core shape is still a circle it's probably fine.

So I probably want to try rationalising these two methods first, then see what options I have for making the label formatting more flexible.

### Other methods that need to be rationalised/removed

I've removed getMonthLabels; some other methods that also need to be rationalised:

* getMonthSectors
* getDateLabel/getYearLabel
* getPeriodDayTicks



Different label formatting
--------------------------

getSectorLabels currently takes string sectorType arg that gets used for two things:
* the group (g) class
* passed to formatLabel as the labelType

So for now without changing anything else I can just use a different sectorType to do what I want.

### Text on a curve
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/svg/curved-text-along-path/

Would like to be able to do this - would need a section of the sector curve to use.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/textPath

I've added an experimental application of this for the year text, but I need to sort out how to do negative angles for the bottom half of the clock.

Once that's figured out it needs to be applied to the month names here.
Probably also for the plain-svg theme.


getMonthSectors -> getSectors
-----------------------------

Another leftover to be refactored out.
There will be some flow-on changes from this because of some of the classnames used:
* getMonthSectors: ${month.code}
* getSectors: ${sectorType}-${sector.name}

The sector names aren't really appropriate to use as classnames all the time as they might change or be locale dependent.
I think I need to normalise this to a local id - this will replace the old `month.code`.

I've gone through and added an 'id' attribute to the various period arrays to use for classes.
It's also starting to be a bit more consistent about group naming, but more to be done.
There really is a lot of css that should be tidied up too.


### Testing
While I'm doing this it's getting hard to spot all the places where I've inadvertently missed properties.
See [simple testing](<simple testing.md>) for a quick and dirty solution.
I know there are some data attributes in the old clocks that currently have `undefined`s in them - will use that task to sort them out properly.


Curved paths for month names
----------------------------

Curved paths will probably only make sense for radial label orientations, but I should allow for inversions.
I'll use the plain-svg theme that I've been tweaking as a rider to this task to test the inversion.

Not sure yet how this will work, but will figure it out.

I think this will need to be a new label setting in additions to the existing ones.

This could get a bit messy.
There are a few bits of the current label calcs that would go away or need to be changed a little for curved paths.
Unless I'm doing it wrong, the only things needed (for now) for text on a curved path are the curve and startOffset.

	<textPath startOffset="50%" xlink:href="#dateLabelPath">${text}</textPath>

The startOffset 50% would be equivalent to the current `sectorPosition : 0.5,`.

These vars wouldn't be needed:
* radiansLabel
* center (x and y)
* transform
* rotate

Should I shoehorn this into the existing method or write a new one?
I've gone with a new method, it's different enough that it's probably justified.


### Inversion & plain-svg

As I said I've been tweakang the plain-svg theme a bit along with this task.
I've gotten the inversion working for it, but I might tack on a few more changes as well.
It really should be renamed, as 'plain-svg' was just the name for while I was removing Snap.
Mostly it's just the brice theme with a few embellishments.

I've tweaked it a little bit more, might end up renaming it to something like 'glass' and give it a proper background.


New/updated Hands
-----------------

This is probably the last thing I want to do for the vintage clock.
There are other bits of polish that might be nice, but this is getting pretty close to mvp.

I'd like to add at least one, maybe two, new hand designs for the vintage clock.
The original hand could also use a little work so that I can resize it naturally without having to overdo the stroke-width.
This might actually be tricky to do well.
Some other options that might help:
* scale with transforms
* border/stroke behind  (paint-order: stroke;)

There are a few competing concerns here I think:
* keeping the hand units in the same unit scale as the rest of the drawing
* keeping the stroke-width similar in size to other borders such as sectors/text
* styling the path stroke with linecap, linejoin, width etc to achieve smooth corners


### Hole hand

I've run ahead and added a couple of proof-of-concept hand methods.

First is a more configurable version of the original hand that includes a proper radius for the pointer tip so I should be able to avoid abusng stroke properties.

Second is a hand with a hole in it - an idea I'd been wondering about while looking at photos of vintage clocks.
Some actual examples have attractive swirls and shapes, I can't code those by hand would need to scan+vectorify in inkscape.

Both new hands are still in early stages and need a lot more polish to get the parameters right and properly exposed by the methods.

The idea for the hole-hand was originally that static parts of the clock face would be circled as the hand turned (the year and logo for the vintage clock).

But immediately I started wondering whether filters could be used to apply effects to things in the circle.
So I've starting playing around with the idea of placing a lens in the hole.
Unfortunately so far I can only apply colour transparencies - filters seem to apply only to the element itself, not to what's underneath.
Will try to figure out if there's a way to do it though (i think it can be done), because a stack of potentially very interesting effects could ensue.
For instance the plain-svg theme that I've moving towards a glassy sort of idea could gain some extra blur/translucency effects.


Bingo - think this is it:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter

Or maybe not... might have to use svg filters instead

Look into filter `in="BackgroundImage"` / `in="BackgroundAlpha"` with `enable-background="new"`.

Hmmm.... deprecated??

### Wrap it up

I've been looking into ways to achieve lens effects in svg but it's taking too long, and while I think it can probably be done, I want to wrap this up and move onto other things.

For now:
* Clean up the new hand functions and parameterise properly
* Add abililty to use different hand functions for year & month
* Use a new custom hand shape for the year
* Use the hole-hand for month, and set the hole over the day/date ring
* Add a simple transparency & mask effect to the lens

Another thought while I'm here... probably want to shift terminlogy at some stage away from 'hands' to something a bit more generic like 'pointers'. Not 100% sure yet though.


### Functional
Need to find the right pattern here...

Am trying to pass a function reference but it's not working?
Was trying to pass the hand path function to the hand builder like this:
```js
	year : {
		length : 850,
		function : this.getHand1,
	},
```
Doesn't seem to be my use of 'function' as a key name here, it fails no matter what I call it.
The method I pass the hand config to sees the 'function' element as undefined.

Trying a few random variants, and have stumbled upon something that seems to work, but buggered if I know why.
(Seems like every time i try to 'properly' understand JS it just evades me. One day maybe.)
Changing the above the following:
```js
	year : {
		length : 850,
		function : ()=>this.getHand1,
	},
```
Passes a function that can can be evaluated and run in `getHands`:
```js
// get year hand
const yearHandFunc = (handConfig.year.function) ? handConfig.year.function() : this.getBasicHand;
const yearHand = yearHandFunc(handConfig.year.length, yearTransform, 'yearHand', '');
```

Why and how this works is ... mysterious - I really should try to boil this down.


### Dressing

I've quickly added a lens gradient mask to the lens which looks not-too-bad.



Wrapup
------

The temptation at this point is to tweak everything more.
There's lots of little things that I reckon could still be done, but I really want to get it out there first.

* Renamed the old 'sector-day' theme to 'vintage'
* Added retro/vintage style wallpaper background & wooden clock body
* Moved some of the period arrays out of the displayDate builder to their respective themes
* Also moved the period array radian calcs to the themes
* Removed old methods: getMonthLabels, getMonthSectors
* Added ability to draw text on arc paths
* Some tweaks and updates for the 'plain-svg' theme
* Added some new customisable hands, including one with a lens (need more work)
* Added a little 12 pointed star icon representing the months
* Hands are now more configurable, but more work needed


New tasks:
* car dashboard theme - to test different angular contexts
* add some basic testing

Additionally a few days ago I added a GitHub pages build for this project, so the clock is now live out there on the internet; there are various tidies I'd like to make in respect to that.




Follow-up
---------

A few little additional visual tweaks:
* Update text centering for day-name ring
* Push the month numbers out a little bit to connect with month-name ring better
* Lengthen year hand and make the disc bigger so it can be seen under the month-hand disc
* Specify 'Noto Serif' as the primary font so that chromium uses it (on linux at least). Will need some more platform testing here.
* Add a simple emboss to the body and face. Looks nice, but on chromium this weirdly lightens the shadows (???) I think chromium does it wrong fwiw.
* Add a little pin to the hand centre
