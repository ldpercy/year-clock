Changeover to temporal
======================


Convert from the old js Date objects to Temporal.

At the time of writing only available in FireFox and Deno, looks to be coming to chrome early in 2026 with version 144.

I expect there are polyfills available for Node and other browsers.

As noted in [October bug](<2.㋉🐛 - october bug.md>) this won't be a quick or easy change, so prob want to break it down into smaller chunks to release piece-wise.

If I can easily fallback to old code where Temporal isn't available that would be nice, otherwise I'm going to slap on a Browser Wars era 'Best Viewed In' badge for larks.
