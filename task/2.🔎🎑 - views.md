Can't believe I've only just discovered this:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/view

Not in my old SVG book, so must have been added somewhere along the way.


From a v.quick test, doesn't work straight off with inline SVG, see what options there might be, scripting etc.


It looks like this might not be an easy option for inline svg - I think it only works natively for SVG linked with a genuine URL.
There may still be other ways to use it though:
* Use view elements as semantic storage for views, but apply them via scripting
* Try a self-contained version of the clock inserted into the html with an embed/img/iframe (etc) such that anchors could work 'naturally'


Quick experiment with coding in views
-------------------------------------

A fairly easy option would be to just add 'view' as a clock param so the regular svg generation process of just uses the requested viewBox.
Like this the views would be clock config.
They could still be generated as view tags, but it would be optional.
