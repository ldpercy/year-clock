I thought year-clock might end up a bit more involved, but so far going okay.
I'm mostly just doing minimal changes though.
The typing for DisplayDate especially really needs attention/refactoring.

Not sure about this one though:

```js
class YearclockDate extends Date {

	constructor(date) {
		super(...arguments);		// ts error here
	}
	...
}
```

I'm not sure yet how to correctly type this - the JS date object intrinsically takes a variable number and type of arguments, and I want that flexibility passed through.
For now at least.
Chances are that I'll want to refactor the shizz out of this pretty soon, hopefully with Temporal.
Just going to ignore for now, keep looking around, and work towards refactoring.
