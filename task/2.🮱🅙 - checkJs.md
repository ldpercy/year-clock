I thought year-clock might end up a bit more involved, but so far going okay.
I'm mostly just doing minimal changes though.
The typing for DisplayDate especially really needs attention/refactoring.

Not sure about this one though:

```js
class YearclockDate extends Date {

	constructor(date) {
		super(...arguments);		// ts error here
	}
	...
}
```
