Add hovers
==========

I'd like to add a few simple hover animations for various bits of the clock like the hands.

Mostly just eye-candy, but could be used to help readability.

See also this that I did **not** know could be done, it's pretty cool:

It would be worth investigating whether a technique like this could be used in conjunction with `use` elements to allow styling certain items purely in css.
Tick marks for days would be a good candidate for experimentation as it would mean you could move some lengths out of the config.
