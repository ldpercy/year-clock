Move original to directory
==========================


This might get a bit involved.

Basically I want to split out everything that's specific to the styling of the original version and place it in a dedicated directory.

All working towards [customisation](customisation.md).



Initial move
------------

Not sure if the custom skins should implement the entire drawClock function, or just parts of it.

Wrapup
------

Will continue this thought in the customisation task, for now the initial move is done.
