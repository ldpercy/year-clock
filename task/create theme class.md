Create theme class
==================

Themes are currently just properties and functions that get loaded into a global `theme` object.

I'd like to try some more structured approaches so that I can load multiple themes at once.

This idea is to create theme classes, out of which individual clock instances can be created and instantiated on the page.

This one is tentative as I'm not sure it's the necessarily the best approach, but I'd like to try it to see how it pans out.
