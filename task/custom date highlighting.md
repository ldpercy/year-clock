Custom Date Highlighting
========================

From: [lightning theme](<./v0/20 - lightning theme.md>)

The lightning theme required some simple class additions for highlighting drawn parts of the current display date.

Nothing too complicated there, but the idea quickly lends itself to various kinds of generalisations.

* Highlight/label specific dates from config
* Highlight/label other date parts (month/week etc)
* Highlight/label date periods
* Add highlights to already drawn parts, or added as new layers above/between other clock parts
* Highlights as hovers or other animated parts

The ideas are endless, want to have a think about where to start.
