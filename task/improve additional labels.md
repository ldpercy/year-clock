Improve additional labels
=========================

As mentioned in the lightning-theme wrapup.

By 'additional' labels I mean the general year or date informational labels that are attached the clock (usually just before the hands).

The methods could be renamed; there's some old logic in there that needs revisiting, and the whole thing could be redone a bit to allow for more labels in general - something I want for the lightning theme, but also the `interactivity` task.
