Point to middle of period
=========================

Currently the year hand points to the *start* of the date being indicated, for example on 1st Jan it points exactly verically.

For time which is continuous generally I'd prefer hands point to the middle of indicated periods.

For Jan 1 then the hand should point slightly to the right of vertical.
