Retro clock
===========

This is an idea I had while updating the hands for the vintage clock.

In SVG as well as simple circles you can draw ellipses, and circle parts (path arcs) allow for specifying x and y radii.

So I had the idea of doing a squashed elliptical clock face, something like a groovy mid-century/50s/60s mantle clock.

Some bits like the body/face probably won't be hard, but figuring out how to place labels, draw elliptically stretched sectors/markers etc could be quite interesting.

In a similar vein a squared out clock face (thinking 70s/80s?) could be an interesting future challenge.
