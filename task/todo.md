* Remove radians calcs from other date arrays in `date.js` (had already done some)
* Continue work on plain-svg, esp knock-out effect for text
* Do something with the footer
* Add option to hide the form
* Fonts - find some web-safe ones or figure out serving
* Rename hands to pointers
* Improve test page parameterisation
* See if date presets (Pi Day etc) can be added as datalist suggestions
* See if favicons can be controlled by css at all
* Look into stroke gradients
* Add extra label to wall-clock
* Make pointer-sector position configurable (start/middle/fractional)
* Look into: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/d#using_d_as_a_css_property
