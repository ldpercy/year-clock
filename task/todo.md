Small job reminders to wrap into other tasks.

* Figure out out if there are 'safe' ways of capturing keyboard events so i can do continuous date +/-
* Finish cleaning up new hands & promote to ThemeBase
* Revisit vintage theme lens and hand length
* Remove radians calcs from other date arrays in `date.js` (had already done some)
* Continue work on plain-svg, esp knock-out effect for text
* Do something with the footer
* Add option to hide the form
* Fonts - find some web-safe ones or figure out serving
* Rename hands to pointers
* Improve test page parameterisation
* Look into stroke gradients
* Make pointer-sector position configurable (start/middle/fractional)
* Look into: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/d#using_d_as_a_css_property



* Add extra label to wall-clock -> in progress
* See if date presets (Pi Day etc) can be added as datalist suggestions -> work in Chromium, do nothing in FF
* See if favicons can be controlled by css at all -> appears not
