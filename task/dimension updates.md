Dimension updates
=================

A few things that have been on my mind, not 100% about.


### Proper resizing to 1200/2400

The initial resize was fine, but I'm finding myself wanting to standardise the clockface itself to 1200/2400 so I don't have to trim the numbers to accommodate surrounds/shadows etc.

External features would go beyond the 1200 radius, which would then need...


### Allow for viewbox customization

The viewbox is currently hardcoded in the main html page.
I'd like to add options to customise it a bit.
For instance if you wanted a larger or non-square clock surround you could push out viewbox to accommodate it.


### SVG size and width

I don't think they're right. Have a look.

Probably most of the SVG tag could be pushed into the drawclock function somehow.
