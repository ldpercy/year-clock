October bug
===========


Probably a counting/off-by-one error of some sort.

Only just noticed this, am still investigating.
Appears to be an error in month-day angle calculation putting the hands in wrong spot, but seemingly only in October???

Affected that I can see easily:
* vintage
* car-dashboard
* wall-clock

Wheel, solar and space are probably similarly affected, but a little harder to spot on those.

This is getting weirder and weirder.
Some years or year ranges seem affected, other not.
Checking using `&date=1970-10-15&theme=vintage`.

These look correct:

	1900-1970 *except* 1943
	2000

These show the bug:

	1943
	1971-1999
	2001 onwards, up until at least 2200, haven't gone further
