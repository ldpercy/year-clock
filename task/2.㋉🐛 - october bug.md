October bug
===========


Probably a counting/off-by-one error of some sort.

```
2025-11-24		Open	㋉🐛
2025-11-25		Start work
```

Only just noticed this, am still investigating.
Appears to be an error in month-day angle calculation putting the hands in wrong spot, but seemingly only in October???

*	index.html?test=true&theme=vintage&date=2006-10-13


Affected that I can see easily:
* vintage
* car-dashboard
* wall-clock

Wheel, solar and space are probably similarly affected, but a little harder to spot on those.



Start work
----------

This is getting weirder and weirder.
Some years or year ranges seem affected, other not.
Checking using `&date=1970-10-15&theme=vintage`.

These look correct:

	1900-1970 *except* 1943
	2000

These show the bug:

	1943
	1971-1999
	2001 onwards, up until at least 2200, haven't gone further


Testing
-------

I'll probably end up finding the error first, but I really need to work on some test suites.
In this case being able to quickly run through a sequence of dates and see certain results as text would be ideal.
At the moment smoke testing is the only and default test; I'll start adding some more options.

I've added a little 'October' test to verify what I'm seeeing.

The discrepancy lies in the difference between:

	displayDate.daysInMonth				// this is correct
	displayDate.monthRange.length		// this is incorrect for the ranges outlined above


So `monthRange.length` is wrong sometimes for some reason, and so far only in October.

It defers its calc to `dayDifference`.


dayDifference & daylight savings
--------------------------------

```js
	return Math.floor((truncateTime(date2) - truncateTime(date1)) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
```

This is probably a line of code i snarfed from SO, so yeah blames on me.


It's looking like it might be related to daylight savings.
Most of the 'good' Octobers have their ends as:

 	end: Date Sun Nov 01 1970 00:00:00 GMT+1000 (Australian Eastern Standard Time)

Whereas the 'bad' Octobers have:

	end: Date Mon Nov 01 1971 00:00:00 GMT+1100 (Australian Eastern Daylight Time)

This is the general rule, though there appear to be one or two exceptions.

* 1971 must have been when daylight savings was introduced into eastern Australia
* 2000 might have been a special change for the Sydney Olympics - the bug is in August of that year
* 1943 could be war related?

So there's probably a corresponding April bug as well.


### April bug

Can't find any. The maths must be kinder to that changeover.
