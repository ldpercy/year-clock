Firefox using UTC for new date
==============================


As reported in [14 month hand](<14 - month hand.md>)


Appears to be caused by `privacy.resistFingerprinting`.

There doesn't appear to be an easy way to switch this off for local files though.

	privacy.resistFingerprinting.exemptedDomains

Doesn't seem to understand file protocol or other local paths, or I haven't gotten the syntax right yet.

Apparently there's a setting to disable timezone spoofing:

	privacy.resistFingerprinting.spoofTimezone

But I'd rather not do that for my general profile.

I'll create a new development profile for firefox with fairly vanilla settings.


Wrapup

Okay done new profile set up, new Date reporting correctly now.
