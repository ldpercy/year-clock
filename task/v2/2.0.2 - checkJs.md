I thought year-clock might end up a bit more involved, but so far going okay.
I'm mostly just doing minimal changes though.
The typing for DisplayDate especially really needs attention/refactoring.

Not sure about this one though:

```js
class YearclockDate extends Date {

	constructor(date) {
		super(...arguments);		// ts error here
	}
	...
}
```

I'm not sure yet how to correctly type this - the JS date object intrinsically takes a variable number and type of arguments, and I want that flexibility passed through.
For now at least.
Chances are that I'll want to refactor the shizz out of this pretty soon, hopefully with Temporal.
Just going to ignore for now, keep looking around, and work towards refactoring.


Wrapup
------

I'm going to wind this up here as all the initial red squigglies have been 'resolved'.

* Added minimal `jsconfig.json` to turn on JS type checking
* 'target' and 'module' needed setting to allow latest features
* Fixed the typing issues that were identified
* I've ignored the Date constructor spread issue for now as it wasn't a simple fix, and that code is going to be refactored soon anyway


Further work:
* All further experiments with JSDoc and typing will be done in future tasks
