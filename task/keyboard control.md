Keyboard control
================

I generally don't like it when websites take over the keyboard or interfere with ordinary browser features.

But i really want to be able to do continuous date addition and subtraction, and I want to do it with the keyboard.

So I need to find out how to do it, and do it in the most unobtrusive way.
