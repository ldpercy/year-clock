Vintage clock
=============

I've been messing about with different fonts and colours on the wall clock to try to get a more old-timey look.
Only so much I can do with styles, will begin a new theme.

This one could use some more fancy SVG features like gradients to try simulating things wood grain, embossing, aging etc.
Could finally add some different hand shapes as well.

I'll reuse the old sector-day theme that's been sitting neglected.

Wallpaper and body
------------------
Have these added using some basic gradients - looks okay in a cartoony sort of way.

Will start working on the actual clock face next.


Plain-svg & Hands
-----------------
Also have tweaked the old plain-svg theme for fun to produce a translucent glassy sort of effect that looks nice with darker backgrounds.
The stroke-width for the hand needs to be sorted out though.
I've used it to fatten the hand in some cases, but that messes up setting an actual outline, which I want in this case.
I want to create some new hands for the vintage clock so will try to sort them out together.
