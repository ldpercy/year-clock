Vintage clock
=============

I've been messing about with different fonts and colours on the wall clock to try to get a more old-timey look.
Only so much I can do with styles, will begin a new theme.

This one could use some more fancy SVG features like gradients to try simulating things wood grain, embossing, aging etc.
Could finally add some different hand shapes as well.

I'll reuse the old sector-day theme that's been sitting neglected.
