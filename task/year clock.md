Year Clock
==========


Original Features
-----------------

* Date and language are parameterised, eg http://year-clock.net/?date=2025-09-09&language=fr
* Leap-year days in February work
* The needle points at the *start* tick mark of the day, not the middle of it.


Some ideas
----------

* Add month and time-of-day hands
* All parts of the clock face customisable
* Different starting orientations, eg summer centered at top
