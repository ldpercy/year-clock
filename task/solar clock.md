Solar clock
===========


This is the long-awaited theme to show things like sun and moon dynamics/phases etc.

Some ideas from the wheel clock task:

* Sun in center
* Fisheye background
* Year-month ring
* Either offset the sun *or* the year-month ring to suggest the seasonal distance from the sun
* Could even hint at the height of the sun in the sky
* Draw moon's apparent 'circular' travel + figure out a way to present lunar phases.
	(The fisheye view might actually make the sun-earth-moon linear relationship less obvious)
* Maybe use diffraction spikes for pointers (if needed)


There's a copy of 'wheel' from when the ideas coalesced in `theme/solar`.


Thinking again about the fisheye view, and don't think it's going to be the best perspective for lunar phases.

Going to instead try a kind of abstract inner solar-system type view.
