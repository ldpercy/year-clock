Convert to HTML App
===================


I'm starting to have a little bit of success with the HTMLApp class in a couple of other spots.

Would like to see how hard it would be to start using it here.

Older & cruftier
----------------

Year clock has quite a bit more cruft in it because it's bigger, older and evolved out of a pre-existing project.
I've come a fair way with js classes now, so looking at it now I reckon there are loads of things to be improved in here.
