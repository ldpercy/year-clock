Convert to HTML App
===================


I'm starting to have a little bit of success with the HTMLApp class in a couple of other spots.

Would like to see how hard it would be to start using it here.

Older & cruftier
----------------

Year clock has quite a bit more cruft in it because it's bigger, older and evolved out of a pre-existing project.
I've come a fair way with js classes now, so looking at it now I reckon there are loads of things to be improved in here.



Done, apparently
----------------

I've changed everything over, updated HTMLApp a little, changed some classnames and namespacing...

Lots of changes to what *was* the setup script for the conversion - now the YearClockApp.
Plenty of room for improvement as it's pretty much the same as before, just wrapped up a bit more nicely now.

But it seems to all be working as before.

Wondering what else I should do in this branch, or just cut it off here... there are so many improvements and ideas I could drag in from the turtle project.
I've already started cleaning up a few things and shuffling some stuff around.
A bunch of stuff in the script folder really should be turned into service classes or class-ified properly.

Tbh I think I'll be better off closing this here and returning in dedicated tasks.
Some of those jobs could get a bit complicated.
