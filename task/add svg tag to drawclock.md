Add SVG tag to drawclock
========================

A the moment the svg tag is hardcoded into the main page and the clock elements are dynamically added into it.
This is a leftover from the original Snap SVG based design.

Want to move the SVG tag creation into the drawClock function so it's complete and more flexible.
