Wheel clock
===========

I've been itching to continue revamping the old 'plain-svg' theme - I'd had ideas about transparency/translucency and using clip/mask for knocking out the text.

But think I've got an idea that could finally give it a new name - turn it into a rotating wheel instead of a static clock face with a pointer.

I did a little version of this kind of thing for temperature gauge on the car dashboard.
Going to do the same thing for the whole clock this time.


Knock out
---------

Getting the wheel to rotate wasn't hard.

Have been wanting knockout effects for ages and think I've finally got an example working over in the svg experiment project, so going to try that next for the month sectors.

The problem is that the knockout mask has to include the shape that you want to apply the knockout to, so in this instance I probably can't separate the sectors and labels (as has been the case for everything so far).

Something's not working - need to simplify a bit and build it up.
No hole-in-one for this one unfortunately.

Have a simpler version going just for the year label.
