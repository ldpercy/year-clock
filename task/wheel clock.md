Wheel clock
===========

I've been itching to continue revamping the old 'plain-svg' theme - I'd had ideas about transparency/translucency and using clip/mask for knocking out the text.

But think I've got an idea that could finally give it a new name - turn it into a rotating wheel instead of a static clock face with a pointer.

I did a little version of this kind of thing for temperature gauge on the car dashboard.
Going to do the same thing for the whole clock this time.
