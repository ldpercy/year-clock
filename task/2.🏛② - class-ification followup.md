Class-ification followup
========================


Follow up jobs from class-ification.

```
2025-10-22		New Task
2025-11-06		2.0.1	First lot of follow up jobs done (2.🏛+)
2025-11-06 		Start on second round (2.🏛②)
```

The main work of converting everything into classes is done.
Now, as far as i can tell, there's nothing in the global window namespace anymore, everything is somewhere under `yearclock`, or `ldpercy` for the HTMLApp class.

But for the first pass I avoided a lot of possible refactors, time to start looking at them.
In no particular order:

* Angles should be converted to angle objects like I've done in Turtle
* DegreeDelta and RadianDelta should be combined and renamed to range, as they usually represent concrete angular spaces, not differences
* Bring in a version of the PlanarSpace class from turtle called something like SVGPage with the cartesian and polar coordinates fixed - might want to wait until I have the parameterisation for that working properly first
* Bring in some of the SVG class from turtle for things like rectangles and viewboxes, probably the grids too
* See if more of the common things can be moved to the `ldpercy` namespace
* Create a proper Event class so that custom ones can be built
* Get a proper PeriodArray base class going to consolidate a lot of disparate code
* I have no idea what to do about localisation yet....
* Probably convert some of the static Date methods to instance methods
* Go back to YearClock.js and sort out some of the methods I dumped in there
* What is currently ThemeBase could probably be largely converted to one or more library classes with static methods, or organised into proper classes.
* Convert a lot what are currently class function fields to proper methods
* Have another look at the function eval style used for the hand config (`function : ()=>this.getHand1,`,`yearHandFunc = (handConfig.function) ? handConfig.function() `) - see if I can do this normally now


There's lots more, but that should keep me busy for a little while :-)


Angles
------

Start with something fairly easy.
Though I'm already thinking about the difference between absolute angles and relative angles (actual angular positions vs between arbitrary lines).
Hopefully that can mostly be clarified by naming and context.

### Deltas & ranges
Looks like I named them deltas because they're set up as a starting position and a width.
Not really a delta then, but i get the idea.
The other good things about that arrangement is that it's clear which way the range goes (+/-ve), and can represent rotations greater than 360 degrees.
Sooo... not actually a bad idea at all - go former me.

### Tear it up
I'm gonna seriously tear up a bunch of the old divisionRadians, dateRadians, blahRadians etc code.
Just torch it and rewrite it so it makes sense.

Here we go...



	addDateRangeRadians
	dateRangeRadians				--> dateRangeAngularRange
	dateRadians						--> dateAngularRange
	divisionRadians


I've run pretty far ahead here, all the angles and angular ranges converted over now.
Still trying to decide how to best handle dateRange-angularRange mapping though, and partially through the 'crappy code' block.
Will return.


Function fields vs methods
--------------------------

At the beginning of writing classes i started out with this style which may have hobbled me a bit:

```js
	getThemeSVG = function() { ... }
```

There are some differences between this and regular method style that I'm still trying to nail down, but for now will convert most things to methods.
I think scopes/this work a little differently between them.


Wrapup for 2.0.1 Mini-release
=============================

Was about to start figuring out day/date ranges.
Half inclined to just push up what I have as 2.0.1 first.

* Add page accent colour
* All angles converted over to Angle objects that handle degrees/radians conversion implicitly
* DegreeDelta and Radiandelta changed to AngularRange
* Various updates for yearclock.Date
* Convert class function fields to methods
* Get rid of evaluation call for hand functions
* Fix lightning dark style



DayRange and Period Collections
-------------------------------

DayRange is a tentative class for storing day sequences.
It's meant to replace `getPeriodDayArray`, but I've only partially converted it so far.

In general though I need much better ways of doing these sort of things.
* contiguous day arrays for month and year
* arbitrary day collections for day-events
* contiguous period arrays for weeks, months, seasons etc
* arbitrary period collections for other kinds of notable time periods (terms, semesters, holidays etc)

So wondering whether they should all be the same type, or collections of the same type or something like that.


There are some features that days and time periods should have in common, and some less so.
Same with collections.
Try to get an organised picture and build from there.

* Whether an array/collection is contiguous or not shouldn't really make all that much difference after it's constructed i think. Keep an eye on, but probably unimportant.
* Days and Dates are probably different kinds of things if that helps. A date is like a coordinate system for time. Different coordinates could perhaps be used, such as unix time or various kinds of epoch times.
* Days and periods will both end up with Angular Ranges a lot of the time
* Pure *moments* in time would theoretically be represented by plain Angles
*


### Temporal
Why haven't i seen this sooner:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal

Sigh.
Well it's not widely available yet, only firefox by the looks, so unless I can polyfill it I might have to hold off.

I reckon though... if it is coming soon-*ish* for chrome then I'd be happy to throw them under the bus for the interim while they catch up 😆.
It looks too useful to ignore, and would potentially save me a whole ton of thinking & own-coding.

Chrome 144, so early new year 2026 according to https://chromestatus.com/roadmap

Good enough for me, I'm going to start using it.


Probably close soon
-------------------

I've also been trying out running things from a lightweight python server.
Works okay and isn't too onerous.
That being the case I'm pretty sure I will want to change to http-only soon so I can finally use modules and other CORS restricted features.

So probably off better to close this soon and do the module and temporal changes in proper dedicated tasks.

So anything else to do here first?

I was about to do some more of the SVG stuff, but I think I'll leave it for now.
Changing over to http and modules will provide a bunch of new ways of doing things, so having some easy jobs to start with might be nice.

I'll close here.
