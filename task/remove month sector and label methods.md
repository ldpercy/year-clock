Remove month sector and label methods
=====================================

As mentioned in the lightning-theme wrapup.

I'm mostly moving to generic methods for drawing thing like sectors and labels but there are a few dedicated period-methods leftover.

Try to get these to a state where they can be switched over the general methods, and remove the dedicated methods.

Similarly the 'tick' or marker methods are mostly pretty old and could use a similar treatment.
