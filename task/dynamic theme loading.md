This *shouldn't* be too hard, as it will just mean re-running the latter parts of the current `setup()` function.

After completing [themes as classes](<[done]/23 - themes as classes.md>) and all the clean up it involved this can now be scripted.
Full clock redraw for now, can basically change all the clock params - style, language, date as well.

Would be quite nice to add some simple UI features to make this super easy.
