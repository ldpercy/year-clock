Adjust labels for short weeks
=============================

Only seen on the lightning theme at the moment.

Weeks are the only date period (currently) that suffer from truncation, and that's only for the start/end of the year.

If month-weeks got added to a theme they'd also get truncated, but less of a problem as the sectors wouldn't be so small.
So for now year-weeks are the main problem here.

A few ideas if the week is 2-3 days long or less, depending on theme styling:
* Turn off week labels entirely
* Custom shrink for the label
* For something a bit different, use a radius function to create a spiral for the labels so the first and last don't overlap
