Add Interactivity
=================

*Was: Add hovers*


Add hovers
----------

I'd like to add a few simple hover animations for various bits of the clock like the hands.

Mostly just eye-candy, but could be used to help readability.

I've been adding title elements and basic hovers over the last couple of themes, and some of these have filtered back to the older themes.

There are more things that could be done, but I've renamed this task to 'Add Interactivity' as I have few more ideas that go beyond hovers.
