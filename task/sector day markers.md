Sector days markers
===================

I've inherited the use of radial lines for days markers, or more precisely day *separation* markers.

I'd like to try a different style of day marker that uses a small sector instead.
It'll be extra to calculate and render, but I'd like to see what it looks like, especially with a bit of nice CSS.

If it turns out okay it will be a good chance to try some [design improvements](<design improvements.md>).
