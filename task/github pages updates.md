Github pages updates
====================

I added a Github pages build to the year clock repo a few days back and it works fine.
The yearclock is up and running at:

	https://ldpercy.github.io/year-clock/yearclock/yearclock.html

But that's a bit of a mouthful so I want to do some trimming.
Also need to update the readme.
