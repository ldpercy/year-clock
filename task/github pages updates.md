Github pages updates
====================

I added a Github pages build to the year clock repo a few days back and it works fine.
The yearclock is up and running at:

	https://ldpercy.github.io/year-clock/yearclock/yearclock.html

But that's a bit of a mouthful so I want to do some trimming.
Also need to update the readme.

* Rename 'yearclock' directory to just plain 'clock'
* Move the original brice clock code to the wiki
* Rename 'clock.html' to index.html

Hopefully should get the clock to run at:

	https://ldpercy.github.io/year-clock/clock/

Actually if I move index.html to the root I should get it down to:

	https://ldpercy.github.io/year-clock/

Will need some updating.
