Custom backgrounds
==================

While playing around with the the vintage clock I'd started creating a wallpaper-style background, and it seems like I can make and customise the backgrounds generally.

So will create a few backgrounbds and see if they can become a page parameter, plus set defaults for certain themes.

Eg as a page style:
```css
	html {
		background-color: darkblue;
		background-image: url(background/star.svg);
		background-size: 5vw;
	}
```
