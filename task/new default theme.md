New default  theme
==================

I'd like to create a new default theme that is a bit different from the style of the Brice clock.

I'd prefer to write in straightforward SVG and vanilla JS if I can, but not sure yet whether there are features in snap-svg that are going to be hard to emulate.

I think I'd better start with breaking up the main drawClock() function first.
