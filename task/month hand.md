Month Hand
==========

So far I've really just been refactoring the original clock, the only properly new feature is theming.

A month hand, analogous to the minute hand on a clock, would be a good new addition.

Apart from making it look more like an actual clock, a month hand would bring some neat properties as the relative alignment of the hands indicate moon phases:

* Full moons occur when the hands are aligned
* New moons are when the hands are opposed
* First and last quarter are when the hands are at 90 degrees

Alignment and opposition also correspond to the possibility of eclipses: lunar eclipses happen when the moon is full, and solar eclipses occur at new moon.

So it would be a cool feature.

**Edit:** It depends on the type of month being displayed:

A month hand based on regular calendar months probably won't show the above relationships, or they'll drift in and out of sync in roughly a 12:13 ratio.
A lunar month hand of the right type is what you'd need.
I'll fill in the details as I work it out.
