Date Ranges
===========

Internally all time periods and date ranges are specified as half-open intervals (unless noted otherwise).

For example the start and end dates for the year `2023` are as follows:

	dateStart: 2023-01-01
	dateEnd:   2024-01-01


For display purposes these can be converted to closed intervals, eg:

	dateStart: 2023-01-01
	dateEnd:   2023-12-31
